# Methodology
Prototype for a real-time crop recommendation algorithm in Python using Machine Learning and Data Analytics. This work presents a system, in form of a website. The business logic in Python uses Machine Learning techniques in order to predict the most profitable crop in the forecasted weather and soil conditions at a specified location. The proposed system will integrate the data obtained from soil, crop repository, weather department and by applying machine learning algorithm: KNN and SVM for a prediction of most suitable crops according to current environmental conditions is made. This provides a farmer with variety of options of crops that can be cultivated.
